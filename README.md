# subsurfaceRobot
MSR final project, subsurface robot

## Overview

The goal of this project is to start from theory and prove out, design, build, and test a robot capable of using impulse-based locomotion on and in granular media. This impulse-based locomotion is similar in concept to a piledriver and utilizes research on the yield stress of granular materials. Whereas other recent research into digging and locomotion in granulat material has focused more on external methods of moving the media in such a way that it is either fluidized or displaced, this project aims to use no external moving parts and rely purely on the impulsed energy from an internal actuator along with potential utilization of buoyant effects in the media.

The technical documents with relevant derivations and theory (in progress) are available for viewing on overleaf at this [link](https://www.overleaf.com/read/srybycnmcjgs).
